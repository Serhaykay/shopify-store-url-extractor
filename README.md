## Usage

### Basic Usage

### Advanced Features

#### Auto-Detection on Shopify Stores

When you visit a Shopify store, the extension automatically detects it and can provide the original myshopify.com URL.

#### Multiple URL Patterns Supported

The extension can handle various URL formats:
- Custom domains (e.g., `https://mystore.com`)
- Subdomains (e.g., `https://shop.mystore.com`)
- Direct Shopify URLs (e.g., `https://mystore.myshopify.com`)

## How It Works

The extension uses multiple detection strategies:

1. **Domain Analysis**: Extracts potential store names from domain names
2. **Meta Tag Scanning**: Looks for Shopify-specific meta tags
3. **Script Analysis**: Detects Shopify-related scripts and CDN links
4. **Pattern Matching**: Uses common Shopify URL patterns
5. **Fallback Methods**: Provides best-guess URLs when exact matches aren't found
